The Srinivas Group of Colleges was the dream of an ideal teacher, A. Shama Rao, and was brought to reality by his noble son, CA A. Raghavendra Rao. The A. Shama Rao Foundation, named after the great visionary, was established by Dr. Rao in 1988 with the goal of providing quality education and fostering ethical, responsible citizens.

Education at Srinivas institutions goes beyond imparting knowledge — it aims to nurture moral and ethical values in students, enabling them to apply their learning constructively.
Today, the Srinivas Group educates over 12,000 students across 18 colleges, located on three campuses — Pandeshwar, Valachil, and Mukka. Each institution is supported by a team of highly qualified faculty and dedicated support staff, ensuring holistic development and academic excellence.
